# üìù Executive Summary ‚Äî Chinook SQL Analytics  

The Chinook digital music store continues to grow, yet leadership faces challenges in understanding key performance drivers across customers, sales, content, and employees. While we collect large volumes of transactional and catalogue data, actionable insights are missing.  

To address this gap, the Data Analytics team was tasked with conducting a **comprehensive SQL-driven analysis** of the Chinook database. This analysis aims to:  
- Identify and retain high-value customers.  
- Track sales performance across time, markets, products, and formats.  
- Understand purchasing behaviors for better pricing and bundling.  
- Optimize catalogue curation and playlist strategies.  
- Evaluate employee (support reps) performance to drive efficiency.  

The outcomes of this project provide management with a clear, evidence-based view of the business. Insights directly inform **marketing campaigns, sales strategies, content curation, and resource allocation.**  

This project demonstrates the value of **data-informed decision-making** and establishes a foundation for growth driven by analytics.
