# ðŸ“Œ Project Brief â€” Chinook SQL Analytics  

## Background  
The Chinook database represents a digital music store, containing data about customers, invoices, tracks, artists, albums, playlists, and employees. While it captures rich transactional and catalogue data, management currently lacks actionable insights to support decision-making across sales, marketing, and content strategy.  

## Problem Statement (from Management)  
As part of our ongoing efforts to improve decision-making and drive growth, we need deeper insights from our digital music store data. Specifically, management seeks answers to:  

1. **Customer & Market Insights**  
   - Who are our most valuable customers?  
   - Which markets generate the highest revenue and average order values?  
   - How many customers are one-time vs returning?  

2. **Sales & Revenue Analytics**  
   - What is our total revenue performance?  
   - What does the monthly revenue trend look like?  
   - Which tracks, artists, genres, and formats generate the most revenue?  

3. **Basket & Pricing Behavior**  
   - How do customers structure their purchases (basket size and value)?  
   - Which products are price-sensitive vs premium stable sellers?  

4. **Catalogue & Content Curation**  
   - Which albums have the deepest catalogues?  
   - Which tracks are not promoted in playlists?  
   - Which tracks are most frequently featured in playlists?  

5. **Team Performance (Support Reps)**  
   - Which employees manage the most revenue?  
   - What is the average invoice value per rep?  
   - How does portfolio size compare to revenue performance?  

## Analyst Task  
- Extract insights from the Chinook database using SQL.  
- Map each management problem to relevant SQL queries.  
- Provide clear insights and recommendations in business terms.  
- Deliver results in both **technical format** (SQL + Jupyter Notebook) and **business format** (reports and visuals).
