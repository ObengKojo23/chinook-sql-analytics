#  üìù Project Brief ‚Äî Chinook SQL Retail Analytics

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Chinook operates as a growing digital music store, offering a broad catalog of tracks, albums, and media formats to customers worldwide. While our data collection systems capture detailed information on transactions, customers, and catalog performance, **management currently lacks a unified, data-driven view of business performance.**

Decision-making around marketing campaigns, catalogue curation, and account management is therefore often **reactive and assumption-driven**, rather than informed by data due to:

- Lack of consolidated **customer lifetime value (LTV)** and **market-level insights**  
- Limited visibility into **revenue trends and product performance**  
- Unclear understanding of **basket size, order value, and pricing behavior**  
- Gaps in identifying **underutilized catalogue content** and playlist opportunities  
- Inconsistent tracking of **account manager performance and coverage**  

This lack of visibility leads to **missed opportunities** for revenue growth, targeted marketing, and efficient resource allocation.
