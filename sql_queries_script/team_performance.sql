       ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS RevenueManaged
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices  i ON i.CustomerId   = c.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId

ORDER BY RevenueManaged DESC;

-- 2. Average invoice value per rep
SELECT e.EmployeeId,

       ROUND(AVG(i.Total), 2) AS AvgInvoice
FROM employees e

-- 3. Portfolio size vs revenue
SELECT e.EmployeeId,

       COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerId) AS CustomersManaged,
       ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2)       AS RevenueManaged
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
LEFT JOIN invoices  i ON i.CustomerId   = c.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY RevenueManaged DESC, CustomersManaged DESC;
